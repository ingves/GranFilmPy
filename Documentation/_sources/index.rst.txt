Introduction to GranFilm
==================================================

GranFilm is a Fortran90 software developed by Ingve Simonsen and Remi Lazzari.
It calculates the optical properties of a substrate which support a 2D lattice of nanoparticles.

GranFilm allows you to play on:

  * the geometry of the particles (radius,truncated / coated / spheroidal particles)
  * the structure of the lattice
  * the materials used for the ambient medium, the substrate and the particles

GranFilm mainly returns:

  * the reflection, transmission and absorption coefficients
  * the scalar potential
  * the polarizability of one particle of the lattice
